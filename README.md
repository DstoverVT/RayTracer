# RayTracer
C++ ray tracing program that renders 3D shapes shaded with respect to a constant point light source

Options to run program:
1. Clone and build yourself using the CMakeLists.txt file in src (I recommend opening the src folder in Visual Studio, should be able to build right away)
2. Go to src/out/build/x64-Debug (default) and run the RayTracerMain.exe executable to generate a Ray Tracing scene with 10 random shapes and a random light source

Where to see renders:
1. Renders are saved to src/out/build/x64-Debug (default)/Renders folder. Renders from RayTracer_main.cpp go to Main folder and those from RayTracer_tests.cpp go to Tests folder

Example render:
